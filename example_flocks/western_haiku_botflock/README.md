# How to Create a Bot Flock

This document walks through the creation of a hypothetical
poem bot flock for three of Jack Kerouac's Western haiku 
poems.

## Step 0: Create Twitter App 

Before you can do anything with a Twitter bot 
you'll have to get an app key from Twitter.

Visit [http://dev.twitter.com](http://dev.twitter.com)

Once you have set up your app through
Twitter developer, you will be able to
see a consumer token and a consumer 
secret key. These are the values 
that go in the file ```apikeys.py```.

The ```apikeys.py``` file is required
to create keys for new bots. Its only
purpose is to hold the consumer token
and consumer secret.

It looks like this:

```python
consumer_key    = 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
consumer_secret = 'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
```
